				<p> Alicia is the kind of person you want to see as a leader in an internship program and what is even more important after an internship also in your team. During Alicia’s internship at Hyland, she was involved in cooperation with Hyland’s Nuxeo NOS team which is based in France and India.<br>
She was successfully delivering tasks connected to QA, User Documentation, exploration, and integration. She was very welcome by the team members and her fast learning, along with her very high writing skills, will definitely make her a valuable asset for the company!
Discussing with her, what she seems to like most is finding bugs and potential improvements and writing tickets about it. Doing so, she applies in the real world what she learned in theory. Last but not least, she is very kind to everyone and very modest despite her impressive studying background.

				<p> I had the pleasure of working with Alicja during their internship as a QA Intern. She demonstrated exceptional dedication and a strong commitment to ensuring the highest level of quality in our products.<br>
Alicja quickly grasped the intricacies of our testing processes and methodologies, and she consistently delivered thorough and well-documented test cases. Her attention to detail was invaluable in identifying and resolving issues before they could impact our customers.<br>
Beyond her technical skills, Alicja was a great team player. She collaborated effectively with our development and product teams, providing valuable insights and feedback throughout the development lifecycle. Her positive attitude and willingness to take on new challenges made her a valuable asset to our team.<br>
I&nbsp;have no doubt that Alicja has a bright future ahead in the field of Quality Assurance, and I&nbsp;wholeheartedly recommend her for any QA role. She is not only a talented QA professional but also a pleasure to work with.

				We all felt that Alicja was a teammate from day one. She's hard-working, open to new tasks, very responsible and patient. She's not afraid to get out of her comfort zone and provide many ideas and solutions for problems, and she's doing all of it with a cautious and optimistic approach. <br>
                I'm crossing my fingers for her new development path. I&nbsp;recommend her as a tester, as she has an analytical mind, good attention to detail, and she's very proactive! IT is definitely her thing!
